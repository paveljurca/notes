yeah, I know about [perl.org](https://www.perl.org/about.html)

"fork it"

do not mention anything about perl6

say a few words about history like
"Larry Wall released Perl 0 on usenet in 1987
then quickly became language of the web and all
the sys admins."

Ruby, Python - they are all nice people
but the Perl community, their hubris,
impatience and laziness, they really
reasonate with me even knowing they
are much more smarter than I'll ever
be, it fascinates me, that's why
Perl is so cool!

"Common things should be easy;
advanced things should at least
be possible."
Larry Wall, noted from the Learning
Perl book, 3rd edition

----
how to get into Perl

Around 2012 I escaped from Windows
to openSUSE, stumbled upon BASH and saw
The Social Network movie where Zuckerberg
"modified that Perl script."
So I borrowed Learning Perl, 5th edition,
learnt only the basics, then almost forgot,
and now it's June 2014,
the Learning Perl book on my desk again
together with a decision to learn as much as I can.

You ask me why?
Because I'm in love with llamas, alpacas and camels!

use modules(it's all about them)

"Making easy things easy
& hard things possible"

you can do a lot.
sysadmins, bioperl.org, mojolicio.us, data munging[link the book],
text-processing, therefore scrapping the web

whatever cool Ruby or Python might nowadays be, you should know Perl first.
If nothing else, you'll always need "quick-and-dirty programs
that you whip up in three minutes."[1, p. 7]

learn from books, look up in your library (techlib.cz here in Prague)

"Camels are there to get the job done despite all difficulties."
[Learning Perl, 5th edition, p. 5]

Maybe you don't see so much Perl around you.
I think there might be 2 reasons:
a) they don't talk about it
b) they are wrong

-> so give Perl a try!

I'm a newbie, probably not even a programmer,
don't know any Perl monk personally but from reading and
doing the Learning Perl book I do understand what an awesome
language, community and philosophy behind it is.

It's a no brainer it deserves much more attention.

I mean, most of students don't know because
on high school or college you do from 95% PHP.
And on Windows you just click buttons - it's strange.
The CMD.exe is nothing apart from BASH on Linux.
Perl on Linux is a great need and it's already there.
Considering the web, every student can come up with PHP+MySQL.
It's their mantra, their dogma. And now my schoolmates
also sometimes know Ruby or Python - because it's trendy.

Where are languages most applied nowadays?
Yes, it's the web! At least it's the realm from
where you get that notion of popularity of any language.

We should ask for what should Perl be used for and is not?
You're not gonna use it for desktop/mobile apps nor drivers.

So it's the web. That's the place from where you'll get new people.
Using one word: it should be "fresh".
That it's unpleasant, high barriers of knowledge, websites with 10+ year old design.
For them computer means mainly the internet.
So they come to languages through web.
The first what they see (and everyone tells them) is the holy trinity PHP+MySQL+phpMyAdmin.
It's a habit more than deep understanding of why.
I mean, no offense but they should know about Perl too.
And Perl should be concenrated in this.
Having one website with all the solutions for the web
- frameworks, modules, hosting, %ENV whatsoever.
Sending a clear message as a place where all the people cooperate.

Doing it in Perl is a real fun!
That is the message: "Have fun."

But it needs to be communicated that way. Clearly.
"For web and for quick-and-dirty tasks."

So Perl should be promoted for 2 points:
a) system tasks, data munging
b) web apps, web scrapping, API

>> I mean: Perl on the web and in your shell.

mojo: convos, sharifulin, ...

Nobody can spend hours and hours of reading Perl docs,
perlmonks, mail archives, whatever to find out what is this
really about.

We want a newcomer to start in a minute.
And we want him to know why.
First impression and pleasant environment really matters.

That's the hint if it's enough cool for him and should
follow through to learn more.

I mean, create an excelent starting point;
something I can show off to my friend and get him curious

Talk to people in their sixteens and show them what
a cool language it really is.
Go to high schools, tell tem, set up volunteer courses
on web development.

I mean the web scrapping is the coolest and most needed
feature today. Parse information to find out.

And maybe because you're still stuck on Windows - on GNU/Linux
Perl is a must-have and completely logical step in a shell

And at first glance it's full of regex and Perl-specific keywords,
I mean, a bit of scary - looks like language for science geeks.

The first what a newcomer should see are quick, neat and understandable
scripts you write in minutes.

Tell the story - the long history, which almost no other language has.

+Bit of centralization, have nice and eye-catchy webdesign for all
Perl-related sites that force you to think it's easy and cool to start
with - as what my peers thinks about PHP/Ruby/Python.
