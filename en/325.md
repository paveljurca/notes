325
===

325 is a proprietary file format used by a multi line text panel called SPECTRUM. The display has 15 rows by 30 columns and it hangs out at some schools and canteens here in the Czech Republic. So instead of dull data like opening hours wouldn't it be nice to have a room schedule displayed there? Whoa, not so fast!

![SPECTRUM text panel]()

The display needs to load all the files at once. That means we use [Windows Task Scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Task_Scheduler) to run a *yet to be written* script every morning just before classes start. Then we call `SPECTRUM.EXE` and site's live!

Files are gonna be `0730.325, 0915.325, 1100.325, 1245.325, 1430.325, 1615.325 and 1800.325`. You're right, these're start times of classes. Now, where's the actual data, i.e. subjects, teachers, rooms and times? Luckily the [university information system](http://www.uis-info.com/en/index) we use has an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API). You request a given URL with a room id as a parameter and get the room schedule for today. And because the world isn't perfect, it's not [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JSON) but HTML. So we'll do [web scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping). The SPECTRUM text panel has of course it's own [charset table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_code_chart) to display czech chars and not exceed one byte. So we ought to remap non-ASCII chars and output bytes. So [pick the right tool for the job](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PickTheRightToolForTheJob). We'll do some [Perl](http://qntm.org/files/perl/perl.html)!

On GNU/Linux you're all set, but on Windows you have to [install it](http://dwimperl.com/windows.html).
